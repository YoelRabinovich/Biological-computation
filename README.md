implementation of a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) for the Iris dataset

The Iris Dataset:
●	A small table is shown as an example of the Iris dataset, with columns for "Sepal Length," "Sepal Width," "Petal Length," "Petal Width," and "Species."
●	The classification problem associated with this dataset is described: determining the species (rightmost column) of a flower given its leaf measurements (other columns).
●	A link to the Wikipedia page for the Iris flower dataset is provided for further information.


Restrictions:
prohibited from using external libraries specifically designed for neural networks, such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, fastai, and JAX.
